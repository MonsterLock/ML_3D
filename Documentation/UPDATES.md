# Updates

## June 21, 2019

I decided the [Rastertek](http://www.rastertek.com) tutorial was a great start and provided the best productivity over time in learning to implement rendering with directX into my engine. I started following the series and bringing it into the existing codebase nearly as is from the tutorial for the time being. I'm genuinely interested in following the tutorials as fast as possible for the next couple weeks and then adjusting it as I see fit after I understand the concepts better. 

It is greatly documented and commented consistently throughout the tutorial. It provides more information in comparison to other tutorials such as [DirectX Game Engine Programming](https://www.3dgep.com/introduction-to-directx-11/) and [DirectXTK Intro](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK/wiki/Getting-Started), in my opinion, but not too much to bog me down until I can get a better foundation to tackle heavier reads on rendering such as [Real-Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/).

Took some time to finally write the first update and organize other docuements as well. Here's a short summary:

- The GUI was the first thing created using Win32 which was a new experience for me along with using the MDI model.
- There are many sub-windows or sub-menu items with different names that temporarily have the same functionality primarily there to "document" what features I plan to add and act as a skeleton.
- The renderer class is able to draw to the 'Scene' window using either DirectX or OpenGL.
