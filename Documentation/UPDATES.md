# Updates

## June 5, 2019

Took some time to finally write the first update and organize other docuements as well. Here's a short summary:

- The GUI was the first thing created using Win32 which was a new experience for me along with using the MDI model.
- There are many sub-windows or sub-menu items with different names that temporarily have the same functionality primarily there to "document" what features I plan to add and act as a skeleton.
- The renderer class is able to draw to the 'Scene' window using either DirectX or OpenGL.
